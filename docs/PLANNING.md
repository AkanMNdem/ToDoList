# Project Planning Document

## Implementation Status

### Completed
1. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - Set up C++ project with CMake
   - Implemented SQLite database integration
   - Added task data structures and management classes

2. **API Server Implementation**
   - Migrated from Crow to Drogon web framework due to compatibility issues
   - Implemented RESTful API endpoints:
     - `GET /api/tasks` - List all tasks
     - `GET /api/tasks/{id}` - Get a specific task
     - `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task
     - `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` - Update a task
     - `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}` - Delete a task
     - `POST /api/tasks/{id}/complete` - Mark a task as completed
     - `POST /api/tasks/{id}/uncomplete` - Unmark a task as completed
     - `GET /api/tasks/completed` - List completed tasks
     - `GET /api/tasks/prioritized` - List tasks in prioritized order
     - `GET /api/prioritization/strategies` - List available prioritization strategies

3. **Task Management Logic**
   - Basic CRUD operations for tasks
   - Task prioritization algorithms based on due date and difficulty
   - Validation of task data (difficulty range, date format)

4. **Database Schema**
   - Implemented SQLite schema with necessary indexes
   - Created tasks table with required fields:
     - id (PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)
     - header (TEXT NOT NULL)
     - description (TEXT)
     - completed (INTEGER DEFAULT 0)
     - difficulty (INTEGER with CHECK constraint 1-5)
     - dueDate (TEXT)

### Current Testing Status
- Basic API functionality tested using curl commands
- Verified all endpoints are accessible and return appropriate status codes
- Database schema verified to match the application requirements

### Next Steps
1. **Frontend Development**
   - Create React frontend application
   - Implement responsive UI for task management
   - Connect to backend API endpoints

2. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Set up automated tests for API endpoints
   - Create unit tests for core business logic

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated build and test
   - Create Docker container for easy deployment

4. **Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Add README with setup instructions

## Outstanding Requirements

1. **Automatic Refresh at 9 AM**
   - Implementation of the daily task refresh at a specific time is pending
   - Options being considered:
     - External cron job calling the API
     - Server-side timer-based refresh

2. **Advanced Prioritization**
   - Additional refinement of prioritization algorithms based on research
   - User configuration of prioritization strategies

3. **Security Measures**
   - CORS configuration for production
   - Rate limiting and security headers
